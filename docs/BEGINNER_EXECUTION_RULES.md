# BEGINNER_EXECUTION_RULES

## Rule
When giving instructions to the maintainer:
- Max 4 steps
- Each step must be clickable actions (e.g., "Click Source Control", "Click Commit")
- Avoid terminal commands unless absolutely necessary
- If terminal is required, give copy-paste one-liners only

## Copilot Prompt Format
- Always provide a single copy-paste prompt first
- Then provide the 4-step user actions
