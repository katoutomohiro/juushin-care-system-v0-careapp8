## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.app](https://v0.app).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.app](https://v0.app).

## Collaboration handbook

All contributors (オーナー、ChatGPT、GitHub Copilot、v0) must review and follow the consolidated workflow described in [`docs/ai-collaboration-handbook.md`](docs/ai-collaboration-handbook.md) before starting any task. Confirm "ハンドブック確認済み" in your activity logs at the beginning of each cycle, and revisit the handbook whenever the update log indicates new guidance.
